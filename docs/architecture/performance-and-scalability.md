# Performance & Scalability

### 10.1 Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Critical |
|--------|--------|----------|
| App Launch (Cold) | < 2s | < 3s |
| Message Send (Optimistic) | < 100ms | < 200ms |
| Message Sync | < 500ms | < 1s |
| Conversation List Load | < 500ms | < 1s |
| AI Categorization | < 2s | < 3s |
| AI Smart Reply | < 3s | < 5s |
| Scroll Performance | 60 FPS | 30 FPS |

### 10.2 Optimization Strategies

**Lazy Loading:**
- Load messages in batches (20 at a time)
- Load more when user scrolls near end
- Virtual scrolling for long conversations

**Image Caching:**
- Kingfisher for aggressive memory + disk caching
- 100 MB memory cache, 500 MB disk cache
- Prefetch images for upcoming conversations

**Pagination:**
- Firestore queries limited to 20 documents
- Cursor-based pagination for infinite scroll
- Cache pages locally in SwiftData

**Background Processing:**
- Sync queue processed in background
- Image uploads in background tasks
- AI requests batched when possible

### 10.3 Scalability Considerations

**Firestore Limits:**
- Document size: 1 MB (use subcollections for messages)
- Concurrent writes: 10,000/sec
- Use batched writes to stay under limits

**Cloud Functions Limits:**
- Max execution time: 540s (keep functions short)
- Max memory: 8 GB
- Set max instances per function to control costs

**Cost Optimization:**
- Cache AI responses (reduce OpenAI calls)
- Rate limit AI requests (100/user/hour)
- Use GPT-3.5 for simple tasks, GPT-4 only when needed
- Monitor Firestore reads/writes, optimize queries
