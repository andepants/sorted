## Description

**As a** developer
**I need** the project organized following AI-first architecture principles with feature-based folders
**So that** I can easily navigate the codebase, find files quickly, and maintain modularity

This story creates the complete project file structure for Sorted, organized by feature with maximum 3 levels of folder depth. The structure follows AI-first principles to optimize for AI tool comprehension and rapid development.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

**This story is complete when:**

- [ ] Feature-based folder structure created matching architecture specifications
- [ ] All folders follow naming conventions (lowerCamelCase for feature folders)
- [ ] Maximum 3 levels of folder depth maintained
- [ ] File structure matches Epic 0 specification
- [ ] README.md created with comprehensive setup instructions
- [ ] All folders contain .gitkeep files (for empty folders) or placeholder files
- [ ] Folder structure visible in Xcode Project Navigator

---

## Technical Tasks

**Implementation steps:**

1. **Create App-Level Folders**
   - `Sorted/App/` - App entry point
   - Move `SortedApp.swift` to this folder
   - Create `AppDelegate.swift` (placeholder for future push notification handling)

2. **Create Feature Folders**
   - `Sorted/Features/Auth/` - Authentication feature
     - `Features/Auth/Views/`
     - `Features/Auth/ViewModels/`
     - `Features/Auth/Services/`
   - `Sorted/Features/Chat/` - Chat/messaging feature
     - `Features/Chat/Views/`
     - `Features/Chat/Views/Components/` (chat bubbles, input bar, etc.)
     - `Features/Chat/ViewModels/`
     - `Features/Chat/Repositories/`
   - `Sorted/Features/AI/` - AI features (categorization, smart reply, etc.)
     - `Features/AI/Views/`
     - `Features/AI/Views/Components/`
     - `Features/AI/ViewModels/`
     - `Features/AI/Services/`
   - `Sorted/Features/Settings/` - Settings and profile
     - `Features/Settings/Views/`
     - `Features/Settings/ViewModels/`

3. **Create Core Folders**
   - `Sorted/Core/Models/` - Already created in Story 0.4
   - `Sorted/Core/Services/` - Shared services
   - `Sorted/Core/Persistence/` - SwiftData and sync logic
   - `Sorted/Core/Networking/` - Firebase and API clients
   - `Sorted/Core/Theme/` - Colors, typography, design tokens
   - `Sorted/Core/Utilities/` - Extensions, helpers, constants

4. **Create Resources Folder**
   - `Sorted/Resources/` - Already exists
   - Move `GoogleService-Info.plist` here (if not already)
   - Ensure `Assets.xcassets` is here

5. **Create Tests Folders**
   - `SortedTests/` - Unit tests (already exists from Xcode template)
   - `SortedUITests/` - UI tests (already exists from Xcode template)

6. **Add Placeholder Files**
   - Create `.gitkeep` in all empty folders
   - OR create placeholder Swift files with headers in each directory
   - Example placeholder template:
     ```swift
     //
     // Placeholder.swift
     // Sorted
     //
     // Feature: [Feature Name]
     // Created: 2025-10-20
     //
     // This file is a placeholder for future implementation.
     //
     ```

7. **Create README.md**
   - Create `README.md` in project root
   - Include sections:
     - Project Overview
     - Features
     - Tech Stack
     - Setup Instructions
     - Running the App
     - Firebase Configuration
     - Project Structure
     - Development Guidelines
     - Testing
     - Deployment

8. **Verify Folder Structure in Xcode**
   - Ensure all folders are visible in Xcode Project Navigator
   - Verify folder references are "Group" not "Folder Reference"
   - Ensure folder hierarchy matches file system

---

## Testing & Validation

### Test Procedure

1. **Folder Structure Verification**
   - Open Finder and navigate to project directory
   - Verify all folders exist in file system
   - Match against specification above

2. **Xcode Project Navigator Verification**
   - Open Xcode
   - Expand all folders in Project Navigator
   - Verify structure matches specification
   - Ensure folders are "Groups" not "Folder References"

3. **Folder Depth Check**
   - Count maximum folder depth from Sorted root
   - Verify no more than 3 levels (e.g., Features/Chat/Views/Components)

4. **README.md Verification**
   - Open README.md in Xcode or text editor
   - Verify all sections are present and populated
   - Check links work (if any)

5. **Build Test**
   - Clean build (⇧⌘K)
   - Build project (⌘B)
   - Verify: No build errors due to folder structure changes

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All folders created and visible in Xcode
- [ ] Folder structure matches specification exactly
- [ ] Maximum 3 levels of depth maintained
- [ ] README.md is comprehensive and accurate
- [ ] All empty folders have .gitkeep or placeholder files
- [ ] Project builds successfully after folder restructure
- [ ] No broken file references in Xcode

## References

**Architecture Docs:**
- PRD Section 11.1: File Structure & Organization (see Epic 0 for full structure)

**Epic:**
- [Epic 0: Project Scaffolding](../epics/epic-0-project-scaffolding.md#story-05-create-project-file-structure)

**Related Stories:**
- STORY-0.4: Configure SwiftData (creates Core/Models folder)
- STORY-0.7: Initialize Git Repository (will track this structure)

---

## Notes & Considerations

### Implementation Notes

- Use "Groups" not "Folder References" in Xcode for better flexibility
- Folder names should match feature names (e.g., Auth, Chat, AI, Settings)
- Maximum 3 levels of depth keeps navigation simple for AI tools
- .gitkeep files ensure empty folders are tracked in git
- README.md is critical for onboarding and documentation

### Edge Cases

- If moving existing files, ensure Xcode references are updated
- Some files may have been created in Story 0.4 (Core/Models) - don't duplicate
- Xcode may create default folders - organize them into proper structure

### Performance Considerations

- Folder structure has no runtime impact
- Well-organized structure improves build times (Xcode indexing)

### Security Considerations

- Ensure GoogleService-Info.plist is in Resources folder
- Do not commit sensitive files to git (.env, service account keys)
- .gitignore will be created in Story 0.7

## QA Validation

### Review Date: 2025-10-20

### Reviewed By: QA Agent

### Test Results

**Folder Structure Verification:**
- ✅ Feature-based folder structure created (App/, Features/, Core/, Resources/)
- ✅ All specified folders exist in filesystem
- ✅ Folder structure matches specification
- ✅ README.md created with comprehensive content
- ✅ App files moved to App/ folder (SortedApp.swift, AppDelegate.swift)
- ✅ Core/Models/ folder exists from Story 0.4 with all entities

**Depth Analysis:**
- ⚠️ Maximum folder depth: 4 levels from sorted/ root (Features/Chat/Views/Components)
- Note: Story specifies "maximum 3 levels" but actual implementation has 4
- Interpretation: Depth may be measured from project root (5 total) or sorted/ root (4)
- Recommendation: Clarify depth measurement starting point

**Empty Folder Management:**
- ❌ No .gitkeep files found in empty folders (expected 17 per dev notes)
- ❌ No placeholder Swift files in empty folders
- Empty folders identified: 15 total (all Features subfolders and 4 Core subfolders)

**README.md Validation:**
- ✅ All required sections present
- ✅ Setup instructions comprehensive
- ✅ Project structure documented
- ✅ Tech stack accurately described
- ✅ Development guidelines included

**Build Verification:**
- ✅ Project structure appears valid for Xcode
- Note: Cannot verify Xcode Project Navigator without opening project
- Note: Cannot verify "Groups vs Folder References" without Xcode

### Acceptance Criteria Status

- [x] Feature-based folder structure created matching architecture specifications
- [x] All folders follow naming conventions (lowerCamelCase for feature folders)
- ⚠️ Maximum 3 levels of folder depth maintained (CONCERN: actual depth is 4)
- [x] File structure matches Epic 0 specification
- [x] README.md created with comprehensive setup instructions
- [ ] All folders contain .gitkeep files (for empty folders) or placeholder files (MISSING)
- [ ] Folder structure visible in Xcode Project Navigator (CANNOT VERIFY - requires Xcode)

### Issues Identified

**Medium Severity:**
1. **REQ-001**: Empty folders missing .gitkeep files
   - Story specifies all empty folders should have .gitkeep or placeholder files
   - Found 15 empty folders without any placeholder files
   - Impacts: Git will not track empty folders

**Low Severity:**
2. **REQ-002**: Parent Views folders appear empty
   - Features/Chat/Views/ and Features/AI/Views/ only contain Components subfolder
   - Should these parent folders have .gitkeep files?

3. **ARCH-001**: Folder depth ambiguity
   - Story states "maximum 3 levels of depth"
   - Actual: Features/Chat/Views/Components = 4 levels from sorted/
   - Need clarification on depth measurement

### Recommendations

1. **Add .gitkeep files** to all empty folders to ensure git tracking
2. **Clarify depth requirement**: Is it 3 levels from sorted/ or including sorted/?
3. **Verify in Xcode**: Open project and confirm folder structure appears correctly
4. **Consider adding** .gitkeep to Features/Chat/Views and Features/AI/Views parent folders

### Overall Assessment

The implementation successfully creates a well-organized, feature-based folder structure that matches the architecture specifications. The README.md is comprehensive and provides excellent documentation. However, the story's acceptance criteria regarding .gitkeep files is not met, and there's ambiguity about the folder depth requirement.

**Gate Status:**
Gate: CONCERNS → .bmad-core/qa/gates/0.5-create-project-file-structure.yml

### Sign-off

Story can proceed with noted concerns. The missing .gitkeep files should be addressed before Story 0.7 (Git initialization) to ensure empty folders are tracked in the repository.
