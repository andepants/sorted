## Description

**As a** developer
**I need** a properly configured Xcode project with Swift 6 and iOS 17+ settings
**So that** I can begin iOS development immediately with the correct build settings and configurations

This story establishes the foundation of the MessageAI iOS application by creating a new Xcode project with all required configurations for Swift 6, SwiftUI, and iOS 17+. This includes setting up build configurations for Development, Staging, and Production environments.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

**This story is complete when:**

- [ ] New Xcode project created with name "MessageAI"
- [ ] Bundle ID configured: `com.messageai.app.dev`
- [ ] iOS Deployment Target set to iOS 17.0
- [ ] Swift 6 language mode enabled
- [ ] SwiftUI framework configured as UI framework
- [ ] Swift Concurrency strict mode enabled
- [ ] Build configurations created for Development, Staging, and Production
- [ ] Info.plist configured with required usage descriptions
- [ ] Project builds successfully on iOS Simulator without errors

---

## Technical Tasks

**Implementation steps:**

1. **Create New Xcode Project**
   - Open Xcode 15.0+
   - Select "Create New Project" → iOS → App
   - Project Name: `MessageAI`
   - Organization Identifier: `com.messageai`
   - Interface: SwiftUI
   - Language: Swift
   - Use Swift Data: No (will configure manually in Story 0.4)
   - Include Tests: Yes

2. **Configure Project Build Settings**
   - Set iOS Deployment Target to 17.0
   - Enable Swift 6 strict concurrency checking:
     - Build Settings → Swift Compiler - Language
     - Set `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY` to `complete`
   - Set Swift Language Version to Swift 6
   - Enable "Complete Strict Concurrency Checking"

3. **Set Up Build Configurations**
   - Create three build configurations:
     - **Development**: For local development with Firebase Emulators
       - Bundle ID: `com.messageai.app.dev`
     - **Staging**: For TestFlight testing
       - Bundle ID: `com.messageai.app.staging`
     - **Production**: For App Store release
       - Bundle ID: `com.messageai.app`

4. **Configure Info.plist with Required Keys**
   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>MessageAI needs camera access to take profile pictures and send photos in messages.</string>

   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>MessageAI needs photo library access to select and share images in conversations.</string>

   <key>NSUserNotificationsUsageDescription</key>
   <string>MessageAI sends you notifications for new messages and conversation updates.</string>
   ```

5. **Verify Build**
   - Clean build folder (⇧⌘K)
   - Build project (⌘B)
   - Run on iOS 17+ Simulator (⌘R)
   - Confirm app launches with default "Hello, World!" view

## Technical Specifications

### Files to Create/Modify

```
MessageAI/
├── MessageAI.xcodeproj/ (create)
├── MessageAI/
│   ├── MessageAIApp.swift (create - entry point)
│   ├── ContentView.swift (create - default view)
│   └── Assets.xcassets/ (create)
└── MessageAI/Info.plist (configure)
```

### Build Settings Configuration

**Swift Compiler Settings:**
```
SWIFT_VERSION = 6.0
SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = complete
IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 17.0
TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = 1,2 (iPhone and iPad)
```

**Build Configurations:**
- **Debug** (Development)
  - Enable Debug Mode
  - Optimization Level: None

- **Release** (Staging/Production)
  - Disable Debug Mode
  - Optimization Level: Optimize for Speed

### Code Examples

**MessageAIApp.swift (Initial Entry Point):**
```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct MessageAIApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

**ContentView.swift (Placeholder View):**
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Image(systemName: "message.fill")
                .imageScale(.large)
                .foregroundStyle(.tint)
            Text("MessageAI")
                .font(.largeTitle)
                .fontWeight(.bold)
            Text("AI-Powered Messaging")
                .font(.subheadline)
                .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
        }
        .padding()
    }
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
}
```

### Dependencies

**Required:**
- Xcode 15.0+ with iOS 17 SDK
- macOS 14.0+ (Sonoma or later)

**Blocks:**
- STORY-0.2 (Install SPM Dependencies)
- STORY-0.3 (Set Up Firebase Backend)
- STORY-0.4 (Configure SwiftData ModelContainer)

**External:**
- None

---

## Testing & Validation

### Test Procedure

1. **Clean Build Test**
   - Press ⇧⌘K to clean build folder
   - Press ⌘B to build project
   - Verify: Build succeeds without errors or warnings

2. **Simulator Launch Test**
   - Select iOS 17+ Simulator (iPhone 15 Pro recommended)
   - Press ⌘R to run app
   - Verify: App launches and displays placeholder ContentView
   - Verify: No Swift 6 concurrency warnings in console

3. **Build Configuration Test**
   - Switch to each build configuration (Dev, Staging, Production)
   - Verify each configuration builds successfully
   - Check bundle IDs are correctly set for each configuration

4. **Info.plist Verification**
   - Open Info.plist
   - Verify all 3 usage descriptions are present
   - Confirm descriptions are clear and user-friendly

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Project builds without errors in Xcode
- [ ] App runs on iOS Simulator (17.0+)
- [ ] No Swift 6 concurrency warnings or errors
- [ ] All 3 build configurations compile successfully
- [ ] Info.plist contains all required usage descriptions
- [ ] Bundle IDs are correctly configured for each environment

## Notes & Considerations

### Implementation Notes

- This is the foundational story - all other stories depend on this
- Use Xcode's default SwiftUI template as starting point
- Swift 6 strict concurrency is CRITICAL - do not skip this setting
- Build configurations enable easy switching between environments

### Edge Cases

- If Swift 6 is not available, minimum requirement is Swift 5.9 with strict concurrency enabled
- For M1/M2 Macs, ensure "My Mac (Designed for iPad)" is not selected as run destination

### Performance Considerations

- None at this stage (empty project)

### Security Considerations

- Bundle IDs must be unique for each environment to allow side-by-side installation
- Info.plist usage descriptions are required for App Store approval
