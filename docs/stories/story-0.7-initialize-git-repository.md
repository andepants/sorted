## Description

**As a** developer
**I need** version control set up for the project with proper .gitignore
**So that** I can track changes, collaborate with team members, and maintain project history

This story initializes a Git repository for the Sorted project, creates a comprehensive .gitignore file to exclude build artifacts and sensitive files, and creates an initial commit with the complete project scaffolding.

**Note:** Git repository has already been initialized. This story focuses on creating .gitignore and making the initial commit.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

**This story is complete when:**

- [ ] Git repository initialized (if not already done)
- [ ] Comprehensive .gitignore created for Xcode, Swift, Firebase, and SPM
- [ ] All project files staged for initial commit
- [ ] Initial commit created with descriptive message
- [ ] Remote repository linked (GitHub/GitLab) if available
- [ ] Commit includes all scaffolding work from Stories 0.1-0.6

---

## Technical Tasks

**Implementation steps:**

1. **Verify Git Repository**
   - Check if git is already initialized:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```
   - If not initialized, run:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```

2. **Create Comprehensive .gitignore**
   - Create `.gitignore` file in project root
   - Include patterns for:
     - Xcode build artifacts
     - Swift Package Manager
     - Firebase (note: GoogleService-Info.plist should be ignored in production)
     - macOS system files
     - Secrets and environment variables
   - See code examples below for complete .gitignore

3. **Stage All Files**
   - Stage all project files:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Verify staged files:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```
   - Ensure sensitive files are NOT staged (check .gitignore)

4. **Create Initial Commit**
   - Create commit with comprehensive message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "feat: initial project setup with BMAD framework and development tooling

     This commit includes the complete project scaffolding for Sorted:

     ```

5. **Link Remote Repository** (if available)
   - Add remote origin:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin <repository-url>
     ```
   - Verify remote:
     ```bash
     git remote -v
     ```

6. **Push Initial Commit** (if remote is set up)
   - Push to main branch:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin main
     ```
   - OR if using 'master' branch:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin master
     ```

7. **Verify Commit**
   - Check git log:
     ```bash
     git log --oneline
     ```
   - Verify commit message is complete
   - Check remote repository (if pushed)

### Commit Message Format

Follow Conventional Commits format:
```
<type>: <short description>

<detailed description>

<footer with metadata>
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### Dependencies

**Required:**
- All Stories 0.1-0.6 complete
- Git installed (comes with Xcode)

**Blocks:**
- None (final story in Epic 0)

**External:**
- GitHub/GitLab account (if pushing to remote)

---

## Testing & Validation

### Test Procedure

1. **.gitignore Verification**
   - Open `.gitignore` file
   - Verify all patterns are present
   - Check that important files are NOT ignored:
     - âœ… Source code (.swift files)
     - âœ… Project file (.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj)
     - âœ… GoogleService-Info.plist (if you want to commit it)
     - âœ… README.md

2. **Staging Verification**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   - Verify correct files are staged
   - Check that ignored files don't appear (e.g., build/, DerivedData/)

3. **Commit Verification**
   ```bash
   git log --stat
   ```
   - Verify commit message is complete
   - Check files included in commit
   - Ensure all Epic 0 work is committed

4. **Remote Push Verification** (if applicable)
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   git log --oneline
   ```
   - Verify remote is configured
   - Check that commit appears on remote repository

5. **Clone Test** (Optional but Recommended)
   - Clone repository to new location:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url> test-clone
     cd test-clone
     ```
   - Open in Xcode
   - Verify project builds successfully
   - This confirms all necessary files were committed

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Git repository initialized successfully
- [ ] .gitignore file created with comprehensive patterns
- [ ] Initial commit created with all Epic 0 work
- [ ] Commit message is descriptive and follows conventions
- [ ] No sensitive files committed (secrets, build artifacts)
- [ ] Remote repository linked (if applicable)
- [ ] Commit pushed to remote (if applicable)
- [ ] Fresh clone builds successfully

## Notes & Considerations

### Implementation Notes

- Git repository was already initialized in earlier work
- Focus is on creating .gitignore and comprehensive initial commit
- Commit message should summarize ALL Epic 0 work
- GoogleService-Info.plist: Safe to commit for open source, consider ignoring for private repos
- Use descriptive commit messages to maintain clear project history

### Edge Cases

- **Already Committed Files**: If you've already made commits, this will be an additional commit
  - That's OK - focus on ensuring .gitignore is correct going forward
- **Large Files**: If accidentally committed large files (e.g., build artifacts):
  - Use `git rm --cached <file>` to unstage
  - Add to .gitignore
  - Commit removal

### Performance Considerations

- .gitignore patterns are evaluated on every git operation
- Keep patterns simple and specific for best performance
- Ignoring build/ and DerivedData/ significantly reduces repository size

### Security Considerations

- **NEVER commit:**
  - Service account JSON files
  - API keys in .env files
  - Private certificates or signing keys
- **Safe to commit:**
  - GoogleService-Info.plist (contains only client-side API keys)
  - firebase.json (emulator configuration)
  - Package.resolved (dependency versions)
- **Consider ignoring for private repos:**
  - GoogleService-Info.plist (to support multiple environments)
