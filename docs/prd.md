## 3. AI-First Architecture Principles

### 3.1 Core Principles

**1. Modularity Above All**
- Maximum 500 lines per file (hard limit)
- Single Responsibility Principle strictly enforced
- Each module does ONE thing well

**2. Explainable Structure**
- File names describe exact contents
- Folders organized by feature, not layer
- Clear separation: `Features/`, `Core/`, `Services/`

**3. Self-Documenting Code**
- File header: What this file does
- Function headers: Purpose, parameters, returns, throws
- Complex logic: Inline comments explaining "why", not "what"

**4. AI Tool Compatibility**
- Optimized for Claude Code's context windows
- Clear interfaces for AI to understand boundaries
- Predictable patterns across similar files

### 3.2 Why These Principles Matter for Claude Code

Claude Code excels when:
- It can understand entire files in one context
- Naming is descriptive and consistent
- Dependencies are explicit and minimal
- Code follows predictable patterns

### 3.3 File Size Management Strategy

**When approaching 500 lines:**
1. Extract view components into separate files
2. Move helper functions to utility files
3. Split large ViewModels by concern
4. Create protocol extensions in separate files

**Naming Convention for Split Files:**
- `MessageViewModel.swift` (Main ViewModel - 300 lines)
- `MessageViewModel+Networking.swift` (Networking extension - 150 lines)
- `MessageViewModel+AI.swift` (AI features extension - 200 lines)

---

## 4. Swift 6 & iOS 17+ Technical Standards

### 4.1 Swift 6 Concurrency Requirements

**Strict Concurrency Checking: ENABLED**

All code must pass Swift 6's strict concurrency checks using:

1. **Actors for State Management**
   - Use `@MainActor` for UI-bound ViewModels
   - Use custom `actor` for background services
   - Prevents data races at compile time

2. **Sendable Protocol**
   - All data models must conform to `Sendable`
   - Use `struct` for models (value semantics)
   - Mark closures as `@Sendable` when crossing actors

3. **Async/Await**
   - Use `async/await` for all asynchronous operations
   - Replace completion handlers with async functions
   - Leverage structured concurrency with `Task` groups

### 4.2 SwiftUI Best Practices (iOS 17+)

**Architecture: MVVM + Clean Architecture**

```
Feature/
├── View/              (SwiftUI Views - UI only)
├── ViewModel/         (State + Presentation Logic)
├── Model/             (Data structures)
├── Service/           (Business logic + API calls)
└── Repository/        (Data persistence)
```

**View Principles:**
- Views are declarative: Only render UI based on ViewModel state
- No business logic in Views
- Extract complex views into subviews (<200 lines per view)

**ViewModel Principles:**
- One ViewModel per screen/feature
- Use `@Published` for observable state
- All async operations use Swift concurrency
- ViewModels are `@MainActor` classes

**Data Flow Pattern:**
```
User Action → View → ViewModel → Service → Firebase
                ↑                            ↓
                └─────────  @Published  ─────┘
```

### 4.3 Forbidden Patterns

**DO NOT USE:**
- ❌ Massive View Controllers (MVC)
- ❌ Singletons (except for services like Firebase)
- ❌ Force unwrapping (`!`) except in tests
- ❌ Completion handlers (use async/await)
- ❌ UIKit (SwiftUI only, except for wrappers)
- ❌ Files over 500 lines

**USE INSTEAD:**
- ✅ MVVM with Clean Architecture
- ✅ Dependency Injection via initializers
- ✅ Optional chaining or guard statements
- ✅ Async/await and structured concurrency
- ✅ SwiftUI with UIKit wrappers when necessary
- ✅ Split files before hitting 500 lines

## 6. User Personas & Use Cases

### 6.1 Primary Persona: Mid-Tier Creator (Sarah)

**Background:**
- YouTube creator with 250K subscribers
- 150-300 DMs per day across Instagram, TikTok, YouTube
- Spends 2-3 hours daily on messages
- Misses important brand deals buried in fan messages
- Feels guilty not responding to fans
- Often forgets past conversations with repeat fans/brands

**Pain Points:**
1. **Triage Overload**: Can't quickly identify business opportunities
2. **Repetitive Questions**: Answers "what camera do you use?" 50x/week
3. **Lost Authenticity**: Copy-paste responses feel robotic
4. **Missed Opportunities**: Brand deals lost in message flood
5. **Emotional Fatigue**: Fans in crisis need immediate attention
6. **No Conversation Memory**: Can't remember what was discussed with repeat contacts

**Goals:**
- Reduce message triage time by 70%
- Never miss a business opportunity
- Maintain authentic fan connections
- Respond to emotional/urgent messages quickly
- Spend less time on repetitive questions
- Remember context from past conversations

**How MessageAI Helps:**
- Auto-categorization surfaces business messages
- FAQ auto-responder handles repetitive questions
- AI drafts use Supermemory to maintain conversation context
- Sentiment analysis flags urgent emotional messages
- Opportunity scoring ranks brand deals by value
- Supermemory recalls past interactions for personalized responses

### 6.2 Use Case 1: Morning Message Triage

**Current Flow (Without MessageAI):**
1. Opens Instagram DMs (15 messages) - manually scans each
2. Responds to 2 business inquiries
3. Skips most fan messages (no time)
4. Repeats for TikTok and YouTube
5. **Total time: 45 minutes**
6. **Result: 40 fan messages ignored**

**New Flow (With MessageAI):**
1. Opens MessageAI app
2. Sees 3 business messages in Business tab (auto-categorized)
3. Sees 2 urgent messages in Priority tab (sentiment-flagged)
4. Taps "Draft Reply" → AI uses Supermemory to recall past conversation context
5. AI suggests contextually-aware response in 30 seconds
6. Bulk-sends FAQ responses to 20 similar questions
7. **Total time: 12 minutes**
8. **Result: 25 messages answered, 0 missed opportunities, responses include relevant past context**

### 6.3 Use Case 3: Context-Aware Follow-Up

**Scenario:** A fan reaches out again after a previous conversation 2 weeks ago.

**Current Flow:**
1. Fan: "Hey! Did you end up trying that restaurant I recommended?"
2. Sarah has no memory of previous conversation
3. Responds generically: "Thanks for the suggestion!"
4. Fan feels ignored/forgotten
5. **Result: Lost connection with engaged fan**

**New Flow (With MessageAI + Supermemory):**
1. Fan sends follow-up message
2. Supermemory retrieves previous conversation context
3. AI Draft: "Yes! I finally went last week and the pasta was amazing. Thanks again for the rec! 🍝"
4. Response shows Sarah remembers the conversation
5. **Result: Strengthened fan relationship, authentic engagement**

**Current Flow:**
1. Brand DM arrives mixed with 30 fan messages
2. Sarah misses it for 3 days
3. Brand moves to another creator
4. **Result: $2,000 opportunity lost**

**New Flow:**
1. MessageAI categorizes as "Business"
2. Opportunity Scoring rates it 85/100 (high value)
3. Push notification: "High-value business opportunity"
4. Sarah responds within 1 hour
5. **Result: $2,000 deal secured**

## 9. AI Features Deep Dive

### 9.1 Feature 1: Auto-Categorization

**Purpose:** Automatically sort messages into Fan, Business, Spam, or Urgent

**Technical Flow:**
1. New message arrives in Firestore
2. Firestore trigger fires Cloud Function: `categorizeMessage()`
3. Cloud Function calls OpenAI API with GPT-4
4. Prompt analyzes: message text, sender profile, conversation history
5. Returns: category (Fan/Business/Spam/Urgent) + confidence score
6. Writes to Firestore: `/messages/{messageId}/metadata/category`
7. iOS app Firestore listener detects change
8. MessageViewModel updates @Published property
9. SwiftUI re-renders with category badge

**Prompt Strategy:**
```
Categorize this message into one of these categories:
1. Fan: General fan engagement, compliments, casual questions
2. Business: Brand deals, sponsorships, collaborations
3. Spam: Scams, bots, irrelevant messages
4. Urgent: Time-sensitive requests, emotional distress

Message: "{messageText}"
Sender: {senderName}
Has previous conversation: {boolean}

Return JSON: {category, confidence, reasoning}
```

**Performance Targets:**
- Response time: <3 seconds
- Accuracy: 85%+ (validated on test dataset)
- Cost: <$0.001 per categorization

**Error Handling:**
- If OpenAI fails: Default to "Fan" category
- Log error to Firebase Analytics
- Retry once after 5 seconds

---

### 9.2 Feature 2: Voice-Matched Response Drafting

**Purpose:** Generate replies that sound authentically like the creator using their conversation history

**Technical Flow:**
1. User taps "Draft Reply" button
2. View calls DraftReplyViewModel.generateDraft()
3. ViewModel calls Cloud Function: `draftResponse()`
4. Cloud Function queries Supermemory API for creator's conversation context
5. Supermemory returns: relevant past conversations, creator's response patterns, conversation history
6. Cloud Function calls OpenAI API with conversation context from Supermemory
7. OpenAI generates response matching creator's style based on historical patterns
8. Cloud Function returns draft to iOS app
9. DraftReplyViewModel displays in MessageInputBar (editable)
10. Creator can send as-is, edit, or discard

**Supermemory Integration - Long-Term Conversation Memory:**

Supermemory stores and retrieves conversation history to provide contextual AI responses:

**What Gets Stored in Supermemory:**
1. **Full Conversation History**: All messages sent/received by the creator
2. **Creator Response Patterns**: How the creator typically responds to different types of messages
3. **Conversation Context**: Topics discussed, relationships with different users
4. **Temporal Context**: How creator's communication evolves over time
5. **Conversation Threads**: Complete message chains for context-aware responses

**How Supermemory Enhances AI Responses:**
- **Contextual Awareness**: AI understands ongoing conversations and past interactions
- **Personalization**: Responses reflect creator's unique communication style based on actual message history
- **Consistency**: AI maintains consistent tone and context across multiple conversations
- **Memory Recall**: References previous conversations when relevant ("As we discussed last week...")
- **Relationship Context**: Understands if sender is a repeat fan, potential client, or new contact

**Supermemory API Flow:**
```
1. Creator sends/receives messages → Stored in Supermemory
2. When drafting reply → Supermemory retrieves:
   - Current conversation thread
   - Past interactions with this sender
   - Creator's typical responses to similar messages
   - Relevant conversation context
3. OpenAI uses this context to generate authentic response
```

**Data Stored in Supermemory:**
- Message content and metadata
- Conversation threads and relationships
- Sender profiles and interaction history
- Creator's communication patterns extracted from history
- Temporal context (when conversations happened)

**Performance Targets:**
- Draft generation: <3 seconds (including Supermemory query)
- Acceptance rate: >60% (sent as-is or with minor edits)
- Context relevance: AI references past conversations when appropriate

**Implementation Reference:**
📖 See [Supermemory Integration Guide](./supermemory-integration-guide.md) for complete implementation including:
- Authentication setup (Bearer token, Cloud Functions configuration)
- Storing conversations (automatic storage, batch operations)
- RAG queries for context retrieval (smart replies, summaries)
- Error handling with retry strategies and fallback patterns
- Privacy controls and data deletion

### 9.3 Feature 3: FAQ Auto-Responder

**Purpose:** Detect repetitive questions and suggest pre-written answers

**Common FAQ Categories:**
1. Equipment: "what camera/mic/lights do you use?"
2. Software: "how do you edit videos?"
3. Business: "how can I work with you?"
4. Personal: "where are you from?" / "how old are you?"
5. Career: "how did you get started?" / "any tips for beginners?"

**Technical Flow:**
1. New message arrives
2. Cloud Function: `detectFAQ()` triggered
3. OpenAI API classifies if message is FAQ and which category
4. Cloud Function queries Firebase for creator's FAQ library
5. Matches question to closest FAQ answer
6. Returns suggested answer to iOS app
7. MessageThreadView shows "Suggested Answer" card
8. Creator can send, edit, or dismiss

**FAQ Library Management:**
- Creators manage FAQs in Settings
- Add/edit/delete FAQ items
- Structure: question pattern + answer + category
- Stored in Firebase: `/users/{creatorId}/faqs`

**Performance Targets:**
- Detection: <2 seconds
- Precision: 90%+ (no false positives)
- Recall: 70%+ (OK to miss some, but don't suggest wrong answers)

### 9.4 Feature 4: Sentiment Analysis

**Purpose:** Detect emotional tone and flag urgent messages

**Sentiment Types:**
- **Positive**: Excitement, gratitude, joy
- **Negative**: Sadness, frustration, anger
- **Urgent**: Crisis, immediate help needed, emotional distress
- **Neutral**: General questions, casual chat

**Technical Flow:**
1. New message arrives
2. Cloud Function: `analyzeSentiment()` triggered
3. OpenAI API analyzes: sentiment type + intensity (low/medium/high)
4. Cloud Function writes to Firestore: `/messages/{messageId}/sentiment`
5. If urgent OR (negative + high intensity): Add to Priority Inbox
6. Send push notification for high-priority messages
7. iOS app updates UI with sentiment badge

**Priority Inbox Logic:**
- Messages appear if:
  - `sentiment: "urgent"` (any intensity)
  - `sentiment: "negative"` AND `intensity: "high"`

**Performance Targets:**
- Analysis: <3 seconds
- Accuracy: 80%+ on test dataset
- False positive rate: <5% (critical for urgent classification)

---

## 10. Data Models & Schema

### 10.1 Firebase Firestore Schema

**Collections Structure:**

```
/users/{userId}
  - email: string
  - displayName: string
  - photoURL: string
  - createdAt: timestamp

  /faqs/{faqId}
    - category: string
    - questionPattern: string
    - answer: string
    - usageCount: number

/conversations/{conversationId}
  - participants: array<string>
  - lastMessage: map
  - unreadCount: map
  - createdAt: timestamp
  - updatedAt: timestamp
  - supermemoryId: string  // Reference to Supermemory conversation storage

/messages/{messageId}
  - conversationId: string
  - senderId: string
  - text: string
  - timestamp: timestamp
  - status: string
  - readBy: array<string>
  - metadata: map {
      category: string
      confidence: number
      sentiment: map
      opportunityScore: map
    }
```

**Note:** Full conversation history is stored in Supermemory for long-term memory and context retrieval, not duplicated in Firestore.

### 10.2 SwiftData Models (Local Persistence)

SwiftData models for local persistence using `@Model` macro.

**Core @Model Entities:**
- `MessageEntity`: Offline message storage with AI metadata and sync status
- `ConversationEntity`: Conversation metadata with message relationships
- `UserEntity`: Local user data, preferences, and FAQ library
- `AttachmentEntity`: Media files with upload progress tracking
- `FAQEntity`: FAQ library for auto-responder feature

**Key SwiftData Features:**
- Automatic persistence with `@Model` macro
- Relationship management with `@Relationship` macro (one-to-many, cascade deletes)
- Query capabilities with `@Query` property wrapper for automatic UI updates
- ModelContainer setup in App.swift with schema configuration
- SwiftData ↔ Firestore sync with optimistic UI and offline queue

**Implementation Reference:**
📖 See [SwiftData Implementation Guide](./swiftdata-implementation-guide.md) for complete code examples including:
- Full @Model entity definitions with all properties and relationships
- ModelContainer setup in MessageAIApp.swift
- @Query usage in ViewModels and Views
- Background sync patterns (write-first, read-first)
- Error handling and retry strategies

### 10.3 Swift Models (App)

All models conform to `Sendable` for Swift 6 concurrency safety:

**Core Models:**
- `Message`: id, conversationId, senderId, text, timestamp, status, readBy
- `Conversation`: id, participantIds, lastMessage, unreadCount
- `User`: id, email, displayName, photoURL

**AI Models:**
- `MessageCategory`: enum (Fan, Business, Spam, Urgent)
- `MessageSentiment`: type (positive/negative/urgent/neutral) + intensity
- `FAQItem`: category, questionPattern, answer, usageCount
- `ConversationMemory`: Supermemory context data for a conversation
- `OpportunityScore`: totalScore, breakdown, reasoning

/// [FileName].swift
///
/// [Brief description - 1-2 sentences]
///
/// Dependencies:
/// - [Dependency]: Brief explanation
///
/// Created: YYYY-MM-DD
/// Last Modified: YYYY-MM-DD
```

### 12.2 Function Documentation

All public functions must be documented:

```
/// [Brief description of what this function does]
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - paramName: Description
/// - Returns: Description
/// - Throws: Error types and when
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// try await functionName(param: value)
/// ```
```

### 12.3 Code Organization Within Files

Use MARK comments for structure:

```
// MARK: - Published Properties
// MARK: - Private Properties
// MARK: - Initialization
// MARK: - Public Methods
// MARK: - Private Methods
```

### 12.4 Inline Comments Guidelines

**1. Feature Planning:**
```bash
claude-code "Create implementation plan for message categorization
following PRD specs"
```

**2. Generate File Skeletons:**
```bash
claude-code "Generate MessageCategoryViewModel skeleton with
all methods, following 500-line limit"
```

**3. Implement Incrementally:**
```bash
claude-code "Implement loadMessages() in ConversationListViewModel
using async/await patterns"
```

**4. Add Tests:**
```bash
claude-code "Create unit tests for MessageThreadViewModel.sendMessage()"
```

**5. Review and Refactor:**
```bash
claude-code "Review MessageThreadView.swift and suggest refactorings
to stay under 500 lines"
```

### Claude Code Best Practices

**✅ DO:**
- Provide context from PRD sections
- Reference specific file names
- Request refactoring before 500 lines
- Ask for documentation headers
- Request test cases alongside implementation

**❌ DON'T:**
- Generate entire features at once
- Skip Swift 6 concurrency requirements
- Ignore documentation
- Let files exceed 500 lines
